# Recent-Trends-in-Teleoperation-Time-DelayMitigation
In ths repository we focused on time series prediction methods to solve time delay in teleoperation

In this repository we created two folder one for Neural Network methods: NN_methods and Statistical methods: Stat_methods. 

## Neural Network methods:

In this folder we developed stack lstm:[StackLSTM.ipynb](StackLSTM.ipynb)
and Seq2Seq model: [seq2seq-final.ipynb](seq2seq-final.ipynb). 


## Resources

* [Seq2Seq Model](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction) - Helpful Github notebook for creating Seq2Seq model for time series prediction with Bitcoin data values.
* [Seq2Seq model with keras](https://github.com/LukeTonin/keras-seq-2-seq-signal-prediction) - Github's notebook for time series prediction with keras library.
